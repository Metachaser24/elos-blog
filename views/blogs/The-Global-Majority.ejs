          <h1>The Global Majority (GM)</h1>
          <p><small class="date">November 22, 2024</small></p>
          <p>Thanks to Magma 1 for bringing the term "Global Majority" to the front of our minds. Thanks to Yele, and Pola for the feedback. Anyone is free to leave comments on the hackmd: <a href="https://hackmd.io/OnKdtxqZSdyUCwpnIcwCJg">Global Majority</a></p>
          <h3>Intro</h3>
        <p>For centuries, terms like "minorities," "developing countries," and "emerging economies" have been used to describe the vast majority of the world's population, despite the fact that approximately 85% of people globally come from diverse regions across Asia, Africa, Latin America, the Middle East, and beyond.  This misrepresentation has shaped societal narratives, perpetuating the misconception that the majority of the world’s population is somehow a "minority." Over time, this narrative has contributed to a sense of marginalization and undervaluation within these communities.
          The purpose of this writing is to propose a new paradigm: it is time for those historically labeled as "minorities" to reclaim their rightful identity as the Global Majority. We can envision a world that fully embraces and respects diverse cultures, religions, and differences, creating a more inclusive global society. Together, we can build a future that values the contributions and potential of all people, ensuring care, respect, and equity for everyone—both the 85% and the 15%.</p>

          <h3>The Birth of GM</h3>
          <p>Around the world, numerous Web3 communities have emerged, rooted in and inspired by their unique ethnic and cultural backgrounds. Examples include Magma and Web3bridge in Africa, Pagoda and EthPadThai in Asia, EthKipu in Latin America, and many other groups not mentioned here. These groups advocate on behalf of their respective communities, envisioning ways to improve conditions and enhance quality of life for their regions. <strong>However, the challenge lies in the fragmented narrative—while each group champions its own cause, the collective voice lacks the strength and unity needed to drive global impact.</strong> At Magma, a residency for African builders, the focus shifted from building solely for Africa to building locally inspired solutions with global relevance. It was during this moment of reflection that the term "Global Majority" was born. We realized that our mission extends beyond Africa; it is about uplifting our brothers and sisters worldwide who have been marginalized under the label of "minority". </p>

          <h3>Ethereum for GM</h3>
          <p>When people think of Ethereum, many immediately associate it with price, followed by wealth, distributed ledgers, smart contracts, and other technical aspects. However, Ethereum is much more than a financial or technological system—it is a tool designed to uphold a set of core values. These values include decentralization, permissionlessness, censorship-resistance, autonomy, and more. The question now lies in who was this technology built for? Ethereum was built for the voiceless—not by choice, but by design. It was created for those living in countries plagued by inflation, corruption, and war—individuals who are often overlooked and ignored. Ethereum provides these people with an opportunity to reclaim agency over their lives, offering a platform to participate in a fairer, more inclusive global system. This aligns with the concept of the "infinite garden," a metaphor for the interconnectedness of life and the continuous cycle of growth and renewal. In this garden, Ethereum serves as the foundation—a fertile soil that enables growth to occur naturally and fruitfully.</p>

          <h3>To Infinity and Beyond ♾️</h3>
          <p>From an African perspective we began by saying that Africa needs Ethereum. Then the narrative shifted to emphasize that Ethereum needs Africa. However, the truth is even more expansive: Ethereum needs the Global Majority. Across our regions, we share commonalities in culture, religion, and practices, while also celebrating our unique differences. Each of our communities is rooted in rich traditions that have endured for centuries, offering timeless wisdom and resilience.

            These methods and values have sustained us for generations, and they hold the power to guide us forward. Together, we possess a wealth of knowledge and playbooks to strengthen one another as we continue to engage in this infinite game—a game of growth, collaboration, and shared progress that has no end. The future is ours to build, and Ethereum is a tool that can help us cultivate it.</p>
